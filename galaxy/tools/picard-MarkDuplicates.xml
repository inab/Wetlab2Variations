USAGE: MarkDuplicates [options]

Documentation: http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#MarkDuplicates

Identifies duplicate reads.
This tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a BAM or SAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from a
single fragment of DNA.  Duplicates can arise during sample preparation e.g. library construction using PCR.  See also
EstimateLibraryComplexity (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#EstimateLibraryComplexity)
for additional notes on PCR duplication artifacts.  Duplicate reads can also result from a single amplification cluster,
incorrectly detected as multiple clusters by the optical sensor of the sequencing instrument.  These duplication
artifacts are referred to as optical duplicates.

The MarkDuplicates tool works by comparing sequences in the 5 prime positions of both reads and read-pairs in a SAM/BAM
file.  An BARCODE_TAG option is available to facilitate duplicate marking using molecular barcodes.  After duplicate
reads are collected, the tool differentiates the primary and duplicate reads using an algorithm that ranks reads by the
sums of their base-quality scores (default method).

The tool's main output is a new SAM or BAM file, in which duplicates have been identified in the SAM flags field for
each read.  Duplicates are marked with the hexadecimal value of 0x0400, which corresponds to a decimal value of 1024.
If you are not familiar with this type of annotation, please see the following blog post
(https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=7019) for additional information.

Although the bitwise flag annotation indicates whether a read was marked as a duplicate, it does not identify the type
of duplicate.  To do this, a new tag called the duplicate type (DT) tag was recently added as an optional output in  the
'optional field' section of a SAM/BAM file.  Invoking the TAGGING_POLICY option, you can instruct the program to mark
all the duplicates (All), only the optical duplicates (OpticalOnly), or no duplicates (DontTag).  The records within the
output of a SAM/BAM file will have values for the 'DT' tag (depending on the invoked TAGGING_POLICY), as either
library/PCR-generated duplicates (LB), or sequencing-platform artifact duplicates (SQ).  This tool uses the
READ_NAME_REGEX and the OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE options as the primary methods to identify and differentiate
duplicate types.  Set READ_NAME_REGEX to null to skip optical duplicate detection, e.g. for RNA-seq or other data where
duplicate sets are extremely large and estimating library complexity is not an aim.  Note that without optical duplicate
counts, library size estimation will be inaccurate.

MarkDuplicates also produces a metrics file indicating the numbers of duplicates for both single- and paired-end reads.

The program can take either coordinate-sorted or query-sorted inputs, however the behavior is slightly different.  When
the input is coordinate-sorted, unmapped mates of mapped records and supplementary/secondary alignments are not marked
as duplicates.  However, when the input is query-sorted (actually query-grouped), then unmapped mates and
secondary/supplementary reads are not excluded from the duplication test and can be marked as duplicate reads.

If desired, duplicates can be removed using the REMOVE_DUPLICATE and REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES options.

Usage example:

java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates \
I=input.bam \
O=marked_duplicates.bam \
M=marked_dup_metrics.txt
Please see MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html#DuplicationMetrics) for
detailed explanations of the output metrics.

                              tools.

--version                     Displays program version.

MAX_SEQUENCES_FOR_DISK_READ_ENDS_MAP=Integer
MAX_SEQS=Integer              This option is obsolete. ReadEnds will always be spilled to disk.  Default value: 50000.
                              This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.

MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=Integer
MAX_FILE_HANDLES=Integer      Maximum number of file handles to keep open when spilling read ends to disk. Set this
                              number a little lower than the per-process maximum number of file that may be open. This
                              number can be found by executing the 'ulimit -n' command on a Unix system.  Default value:
                              8000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.

SORTING_COLLECTION_SIZE_RATIO=Double
                              This number, plus the maximum RAM available to the JVM, determine the memory footprint
                              used by some of the sorting collections.  If you are running out of memory, try reducing
                              this number.  Default value: 0.25. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default
                              value.

BARCODE_TAG=String            Barcode SAM tag (ex. BC for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null.

READ_ONE_BARCODE_TAG=String   Read one barcode SAM tag (ex. BX for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null.

READ_TWO_BARCODE_TAG=String   Read two barcode SAM tag (ex. BX for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null.

TAG_DUPLICATE_SET_MEMBERS=Boolean
                              If a read appears in a duplicate set, add two tags. The first tag, DUPLICATE_SET_SIZE_TAG
                              (DS), indicates the size of the duplicate set. The smallest possible DS value is 2 which
                              occurs when two reads map to the same portion of the reference only one of which is marked
                              as duplicate. The second tag, DUPLICATE_SET_INDEX_TAG (DI), represents a unique identifier
                              for the duplicate set to which the record belongs. This identifier is the index-in-file of
                              the representative read that was selected out of the duplicate set.  Default value: false.
                              This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true,
                              false}

REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES=Boolean
                              If true remove 'optical' duplicates and other duplicates that appear to have arisen from
                              the sequencing process instead of the library preparation process, even if
                              REMOVE_DUPLICATES is false. If REMOVE_DUPLICATES is true, all duplicates are removed and
                              this option is ignored.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear
                              the default value. Possible values: {true, false}

TAGGING_POLICY=DuplicateTaggingPolicy
                              Determines how duplicate types are recorded in the DT optional attribute.  Default value:
                              DontTag. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values:
                              {DontTag, OpticalOnly, All}

CLEAR_DT=Boolean              Clear DT tag from input SAM records. Should be set to false if input SAM doesn't have this
                              tag.  Default true  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the
                              default value. Possible values: {true, false}

DUPLEX_UMI=Boolean            Treat UMIs as being duplex stranded.  This option requires that the UMI consist of two
                              equal length strings that are separated by a hyphen (e.g. 'ATC-GTC'). Reads are considered
                              duplicates if, in addition to standard definition, have identical normalized UMIs.  A UMI
                              from the 'bottom' strand is normalized by swapping its content around the hyphen (eg.
                              ATC-GTC becomes GTC-ATC).  A UMI from the 'top' strand is already normalized as it is.
                              Both reads from a read pair considered top strand if the read 1 unclipped 5' coordinate is
                              less than the read 2 unclipped 5' coordinate. All chimeric reads and read fragments are
                              treated as having come from the top strand. With this option is it required that the
                              BARCODE_TAG hold non-normalized UMIs. Default false.  Default value: false. This option
                              can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}

MOLECULAR_IDENTIFIER_TAG=String
                              SAM tag to uniquely identify the molecule from which a read was derived.  Use of this
                              option requires that the BARCODE_TAG option be set to a non null value.  Default null.
                              Default value: null.

INPUT=String
I=String                      One or more input SAM or BAM files to analyze. Must be coordinate sorted.  Default value:
                              null. This option may be specified 0 or more times.

OUTPUT=File
O=File                        The output file to write marked records to  Required.

METRICS_FILE=File
M=File                        File to write duplication metrics to  Required.

REMOVE_DUPLICATES=Boolean     If true do not write duplicates to the output file instead of writing them with
                              appropriate flags set.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear
                              the default value. Possible values: {true, false}

ASSUME_SORTED=Boolean
AS=Boolean                    If true, assume that the input file is coordinate sorted even if the header says
                              otherwise. Deprecated, used ASSUME_SORT_ORDER=coordinate instead.  Default value: false.
                              This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true,
                              false}  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) ASSUME_SORT_ORDER (ASO)

ASSUME_SORT_ORDER=SortOrder
ASO=SortOrder                 If not null, assume that the input file has this order even if the header says otherwise.
                              Default value: null. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate,
                              unknown}  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) ASSUME_SORTED (AS)

DUPLICATE_SCORING_STRATEGY=ScoringStrategy
DS=ScoringStrategy            The scoring strategy for choosing the non-duplicate among candidates.  Default value:
                              SUM_OF_BASE_QUALITIES. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
                              Possible values: {SUM_OF_BASE_QUALITIES, TOTAL_MAPPED_REFERENCE_LENGTH, RANDOM}

PROGRAM_RECORD_ID=String
PG=String                     The program record ID for the @PG record(s) created by this program. Set to null to
                              disable PG record creation.  This string may have a suffix appended to avoid collision
                              with other program record IDs.  Default value: MarkDuplicates. This option can be set to
                              'null' to clear the default value.

PROGRAM_GROUP_VERSION=String
PG_VERSION=String             Value of VN tag of PG record to be created. If not specified, the version will be detected
                              automatically.  Default value: null.

PROGRAM_GROUP_COMMAND_LINE=String
PG_COMMAND=String             Value of CL tag of PG record to be created. If not supplied the command line will be
                              detected automatically.  Default value: null.

PROGRAM_GROUP_NAME=String
PG_NAME=String                Value of PN tag of PG record to be created.  Default value: MarkDuplicates. This option
                              can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.

COMMENT=String
CO=String                     Comment(s) to include in the output file's header.  Default value: null. This option may
                              be specified 0 or more times.

READ_NAME_REGEX=String        MarkDuplicates can use the tile and cluster positions to estimate the rate of optical
                              duplication in addition to the dominant source of duplication, PCR, to provide a more
                              accurate estimation of library size. By default (with no READ_NAME_REGEX specified),
                              MarkDuplicates will attempt to extract coordinates using a split on ':' (see Note below).
                              Set READ_NAME_REGEX to 'null' to disable optical duplicate detection. Note that without
                              optical duplicate counts, library size estimation will be less accurate. If the read name
                              does not follow a standard Illumina colon-separation convention, but does contain tile and
                              x,y coordinates, a regular expression can be specified to extract three variables:
                              tile/region, x coordinate and y coordinate from a read name. The regular expression must
                              contain three capture groups for the three variables, in order. It must match the entire
                              read name.   e.g. if field names were separated by semi-colon (';') this example regex
                              could be specified      (?:.*;)?([0-9]+)[^;]*;([0-9]+)[^;]*;([0-9]+)[^;]*$ Note that if no
                              READ_NAME_REGEX is specified, the read name is split on ':'.   For 5 element names, the
                              3rd, 4th and 5th elements are assumed to be tile, x and y values.   For 7 element names
                              (CASAVA 1.8), the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements are assumed to be tile, x and y values.
                              Default value: <optimized capture of last three ':' separated fields as numeric values>.
                              This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.

OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE=Integer
                              The maximum offset between two duplicate clusters in order to consider them optical
                              duplicates. The default is appropriate for unpatterned versions of the Illumina platform.
                              For the patterned flowcell models, 2500 is moreappropriate. For other platforms and
                              models, users should experiment to find what works best.  Default value: 100. This option
                              can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.

MAX_OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_SET_SIZE=Long
                              This number is the maximum size of a set of duplicate reads for which we will attempt to
                              determine which are optical duplicates.  Please be aware that if you raise this value too
                              high and do encounter a very large set of duplicate reads, it will severely affect the
                              runtime of this tool.  To completely disable this check, set the value to -1.  Default
                              value: 300000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
