## Wetlab2Variations Workflow Demonstrator

Rare disease researchersâ€™ workflow is that they submit their raw data (fastq), run the mapping and variant calling RD-Connect pipeline and obtain unannotated gvcf files to further submit to the RD-Connect GPAP or analyse on their own.

This demonstrator focuses on the variant calling pipeline. The raw genomic data is processed using the RD-Connect pipeline ([Laurie et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604516)) running on the standards (GA4GH) compliant, interoperable container orchestration platform.

This demonstrator will be aligned with the current implementation study on [Development of Architecture for Software Containers at ELIXIR and its use by EXCELERATE use-case communities](docs/Appendix%201%20-%20Project%20Plan%202018-biocontainers%2020171117.pdf) 

For this implementation, different steps are required:

1. Adapt the pipeline to CWL and dockerise elements 
2. Align with IS efforts on software containers to package the different components (Nextflow) 
3. Submit trio of Illumina NA12878 Platinum Genome or Exome to the GA4GH platform cloud (by Aspera or ftp server)
4. Run the RD-Connect pipeline on the container platform
5. Return corresponding gvcf files
6. OPTIONAL: annotate and update to RD-Connect playground instance

N.B: The demonstrator might have some manual steps, which will not be in production. 

## RD-Connect pipeline

Detailed information about the RD-Connect pipeline can be found in [Laurie et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27604516)
